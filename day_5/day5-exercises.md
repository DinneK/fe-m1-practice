## Day 5 JavaScript

### Chapter 2 - Statements, Variables, Data Types, & Arrays:

1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?
- To declare a variable in JavaScript is to announce the use of a variable by saying var, const or let for example and then naming the variable with a name that has something to do with the variable. The variable name in JavaScript is called the identifier. You then add an equals sign to assign a value to the variable. The equals sign is called a assignment operator.

2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.
- Numbers are a numeric data type that handle numbers. This includes decimals and negative numbers.
- Strings are any numbers, letters or symbols that are surrounded by a pair of quotes.
- Booleans are data types that deal with true or false statements.

3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?
- The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
- The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
- You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
- All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
- Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
- Use camelCase. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.

4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?
- We should use an array whenever we are using values related to each other. Arrays are particularly useful when you don't know how many items a list will contain. Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a number list, an index. The index starts with 0 not 1. You can change the value of an item an array by selecting it and assigning it a new value just as you would any other variable (using the equals sign and the new value for that item)

5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
- Expressions are part of statements that return a value.

6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?
- Three types of operators are assignment operators, which assign a value to an expression. Comparison operators, which allow you to compare to values in an expression. Lastly, string operators, which allow you to combine two or more strings, this is to concatenate.
