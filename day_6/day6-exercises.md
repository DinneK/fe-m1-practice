### Chapter 3: Function & Scope - JavaScript & JQuery

1. If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?
- Entering `sayHello` into the console will return the function `sayHello()` and tell you that the console log has been set to return "Hello!". Entering `sayHello()` into the console will call the function and return the answer Hello!

2. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
- Parameters are words that act like variables, where as arguments real values that are passed through the code to perform calculations.

3. What is the keyword `return` used for?
- The `return` keyword is used to return a value to the code that called the function.

4. How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
- Local variables use less memory and avoid naming conflicts, they allow your page to run faster and have less errors. On occasion global variables are more appealing, if a function or a variable needs to be called over and over again on a page.
